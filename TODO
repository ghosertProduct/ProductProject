1. realrecorder.net is blocked by myhosting.com, check out whether it can be recovered, since I've registered recordsound.net, this may be not my concern...
4. Check out myhosting.com (if it's availabe) to see whether the creditcard in it is new or old one.
7. Add a new file server for host files for recordsound.net and realspymonitor.net.
8. Upload new htm files to loadtrend.com either later. And report loadtrend.com is not bad site anymore.
